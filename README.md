# SEEK 

## Introduction
![CODE LAB](Website/static/CodeLabLogo.png)

Hi, we are SEEK, currently second-year students from Nanyang Technological University with the background of Mathematical Sciences and Computer Sciences. In this era of continuous digital pursuit, it is no wonder of the demand for knowledge of computing languages and the beauty of works computing can bring to us. In line with the chosen theme, our venture, **CODE LAB** is an educational AI tool designed by students for students, seeking to provide personalized education for whatever students wish to learn.

## Theme of Submission üóä 
SEEK is inspired by the theme of **Digital Empowerment**, in which the project statement chosen is by **IMDA --- Creating Opportunities with Emerging Technologies**: 
<br>
<em>"Develop innovative and creative solutions that leverages on emerging technologies such as GenAI to increase access to information and opportunities and empower individuals and communities to thrive in this digital world. The solution could create opportunities and address challenges from digital divide, reduce bias, and promote equity using digital solutions.‚Äù </em>

<br>
## Overview
With rapid advancements in the AI field, we believe we are at the cusp of pushing for positive transformation of education.¬†

One of the key objectives that we as a team want to push for is the **digital empowerment of education through means of personalized learning**.
<br>
<br>

**Pain Points** 
<br>	
Classrooms set a certain pace for all students. However, individuals have different learning aptitudes, abilities and prior knowledge. We don‚Äôt want to confine students to a classroom, we want students to learn whatever they wish.¬†

Unfortunately, the current climate also presents an issue where some communities do not have access to high quality education, due to social or economic reasons. Leveraging on AI-powered online education¬† allows the possibility for all people regardless of their social or economic background to receive high quality education. This hopes to reduce bias and promote equity in allowing everyone to learn and grow their skillsets together.¬†
<br>
<br>

**Solutions**
<br>
With these key issues in mind, as a group of maths and computer science students from NTU, we wanted to address the issue around the education of computer science.¬†

CodeLab is an educational AI tool designed by students for students, seeking to provide personalized education for whatever students wish to learn. Students can learn about any computer science related concept and codelab will bring up a page to teach them that concept by bringing up vivid explanations examples and questions to consolidate the students understanding.
<br>
<br>

**We built Codelab to demonstrate the most powerful use case of AI, which is to use AI to¬†enhance HI human intelligence, human potential and human purpose.**
<br>
<br>

## Get Started
**Prerequisites**
<br>
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (package installer for Python)
<br>

**Installation**
1. Clone this repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/GordonChen19/CodeLab-Source-Code.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directionary: 
```
cd CodeLab-Source-Code
```

3. Create a virtual environment: 
```
python -m venv myenv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment: 
    - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

    - On Windows (Command Prompt):
    ```
    myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

5. Install the dependencies: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>

**Usage**
<br>
To run CODELAB, execute the following command: 
```
python main.py
```
The application will start running on "http://localhost:5000".

<br>

## Features 
**Projects Directory** <br>
First, create a 'Room Name' and type in 'What concept you would like to learn', for instance 'union find'. You can choose one of the following computing languages to code with: Python, C, C++. 

![Projects Directory](Website/static/CodeLabProjects.png)

<br>

**Code Editor** <br>
Upon creating a room, you will be redirected to this page below. For instance, if you specified to learn about union find you would be directed to the respective page  <em>Union Find</em>. On the right, a detailed description of <em>Union Find</em> will be given and a related question will be generated for students to answer to consolidate their understanding. 
<br>

At the bottom left, our friendly Robo will assist you with the problem!
- Click on 'hints' to get help on the question you are working on
- Click on 'solution' to check your answer
- Click on 'code review' to determine how to improve your answer

## Future Prospects 
Moving forward, we hope to expand **CODE LAB** further to incorporate new and improved features: 
- Incorporating more computing languages for learning
- Creating a collaborative space where students can learn together and share their knowledge with one another. This can also be a collaborative platform whereby educators may utilise as a flipped classroom to teach students. 
- Visualisation tools whereby users can create flowcharts to form codes and vice versa 
- Not only for computing, we hope to venture further into other subjects like English and Mathematics, together with the help of Generative AI to create a personalised learning environment to guide students with diverse needs.
